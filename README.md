By analyzing various dimensions such as sales, genres, platforms, and publishers, the dashboard enables users to gain a deeper understanding of the video games market.

The dashboard provides an overview of the dataset, displaying key statistics such as the total number of games, platforms, genres, and publishers. This gives users a quick snapshot of the dataset's scope and scale.

Sales analysis is a prominent feature of the dashboard, showcasing the sales performance of video games across different regions, platforms, genres, and publishers. Through interactive bar charts, line charts, and maps, users can identify sales trends, popular genres, successful platforms, and dominant publishers.

Genre analysis allows users to explore the distribution of games across various genres. Visualizations like pie charts and treemaps provide insights into the popularity of each genre, helping users understand which genres have the largest market share.

Platform analysis examines the performance of video games on different platforms. By comparing sales and ratings through bar charts and scatter plots, users can identify the top-performing platforms and assess their impact on game sales.

The dashboard also incorporates user ratings, enabling users to assess the relationship between ratings and sales. Scatter plots and line charts help users understand the correlation between user ratings and the commercial success of video games.

To use the dashboard, users need to obtain a video games dataset from an external source, such as Kaggle. They can then import the dataset into Tableau, connect it to the dashboard, and customize the visualizations according to their needs.

The video games analysis dashboard provides a user-friendly interface and serves as a powerful tool for anyone interested in exploring and understanding the video games market. It helps users make informed decisions related to game development, marketing, and sales strategies.
